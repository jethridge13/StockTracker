# Stock Tracker

## About

This app is my test project which I am building as I teach myself React.
It is a simple stock tracker app. Multiple stock tickers can be entered
onto one card to easily compare multiple stocks over time. Multiple
cards can be displayed on one screen as well.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites:

### NPM prereqs

The app was created using the create-react-app script. To install all
npm dependencies, cd into the stock-tracker directory and run

`npm install`

If successful, all dependencies will have been installed.

Note: animate.css must be installed under a local node_modules file
as that is where the path to include it points. 

### Python prereqs

This app is only compatible with Python 3. It is not guaranteed or
tested with Python 2.

All of the following python modules can be installed with pip.

* Flask
* Flask-RESTful
* Flask-CORS
* requests

### SCSS

Compass is used to compile the scss files into one css file that is
saved in the React css folder.
